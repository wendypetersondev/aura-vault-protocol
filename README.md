# Aura Vault Protocol

A production-ready, share-based yield vault smart contract built on **Soroban** for the Stellar ecosystem.

## Overview

Aura solves fragmented liquidity and manual yield compounding in Soroban DeFi. It aggregates deposits of a single SEP-41-compatible underlying token, issues proportional vault shares to depositors, and auto-compounds yield through permissionless keeper harvests — all in a trust-minimized, `no_std` on-chain environment.

## How It Works

- **Deposit** — Transfer underlying tokens into the vault and receive shares proportional to your contribution. First depositor gets a 1:1 seed ratio; subsequent depositors get `floor(amount × total_shares / total_assets)` shares.
- **Withdraw** — Burn your shares to redeem `floor(shares × total_assets / total_shares)` underlying tokens, including any accrued yield.
- **Harvest** — Any keeper injects yield tokens into the vault without minting new shares, increasing the exchange rate for all existing shareholders.
- **View** — `total_assets` and `balance_of` are gas-free read-only calls.

## Architecture

```

├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    ├── lib.rs        # AuraVault contract — initialize, deposit, withdraw, harvest, views
    ├── errors.rs     # VaultError (8 typed variants)
    ├── storage.rs    # DataKey, TTL constants, get/set/bump helpers
    ├── interface.rs  # AuraVaultTrait public ABI
    └── test.rs       # 22 unit + integration tests
```

## Security Properties

- **Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI)** ordering on every mutating function
- **Inflation attack prevention** — zero-share mint rejection fence
- **Overflow safety** — all arithmetic uses `checked_mul` / `checked_div`; `overflow-checks = true` in release profile
- **No `unwrap()` / `expect()`** outside `#[cfg(test)]`
- **Soroban archival safety** — TTL extended on every mutating call (30-day lifetime, 7-day threshold)

## Building

Requires Rust with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:

```bash
rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

cd aura-vault
cargo test                                              # run all 22 tests
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release   # build deployable Wasm
```

The compiled binary will be at:
```
aura-vault/target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/aura_vault.wasm
```

## Deployment (Stellar Testnet / Mainnet)

```bash
# Upload Wasm
stellar contract upload \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/aura_vault.wasm \
  --source <your-keypair> \
  --network testnet

# Deploy instance
stellar contract deploy \
  --wasm-hash <hash-from-upload> \
  --source <your-keypair> \
  --network testnet

# Initialize
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <contract-id> \
  --source <admin-keypair> \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --admin <admin-address> \
  --underlying_token <token-contract-id>
```

## Contract Interface

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `initialize(admin, underlying_token)` | One-time setup; stores admin and token address |
| `deposit(caller, amount)` | Mint shares proportional to deposit |
| `withdraw(caller, shares)` | Burn shares and redeem underlying tokens |
| `harvest(caller, yield_amount)` | Inject yield without minting shares |
| `total_assets()` | Read current total underlying tokens in vault |
| `balance_of(address)` | Read share balance for any address |

## Error Codes

| Code | Variant | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `NotInitialized` | Vault not yet initialized |
| 2 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `initialize` called more than once |
| 3 | `InsufficientShares` | Withdraw amount exceeds caller's balance |
| 4 | `InsufficientUnderlying` | Vault cannot cover redemption |
| 5 | `ZeroAmount` | Zero or negative input; or share mint rounds to zero |
| 6 | `MathOverflow` | Arithmetic overflow in share formula |
| 7 | `InvalidAddress` | Reserved for future address validation |
| 8 | `ZeroShares` | Harvest called when total shares is zero |
